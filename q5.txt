Q1: Does the change inside increment_int_a change the variable a after the function call?
Q2: Does the change inside increment_int_b change the variable b after the function call?
Q3: If they differ answer why? if not why not?

def increment_int_a(someval):
    someval += 1
def increment_int_b(someval):
    someval[0] += 1
def main():
    a = 32
    increment_int_a(a)
    b = [32]
    increment_int_b(b)

Q1 Answer: Does not change the value of a it should still be 32
Q2 Answer: Would change the value of b it'll be 33
Q3 Answer: They differ because someval is being updated but not being returned for increment_int_a while for increment_int_b since it is an array, the array value is in fact being updated.
